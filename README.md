## Synopsis

A weather Forecasting Application which tells you the weather forecast of any place over the next 4-5 days in United States of America. Web scraping and Python's GUI Library PyQt has been used.

## Motivation

Web scraping is an important technique that Data Scientists should know and that is what motivated me to learn it. Scraping my first data from a weather forecasting website, I saw it as an opportunity to build it into something slightly bigger and useful. This in turn, turned me towards PyQt from which I was able to give my data a UI to be displayed on.  

## Installation

Clone the repo and run the Beginner.py file. =

## Tests

Keep in mind that this application works for places in USA. Make sure you provide correct langitude and longitudes of places who fall under the boundaries of USA.For example, you could try lat=40/7 long=-73.9 which is the location for New York's Central Park.
